		I	am	a	highly	educated	young	professional	well	known	for	my	determination,	perseverance	and	reliability.	Project	
management,	organisation	and	team	coordination	have	been	key	in	executing	the	deals	and	projects	I	run.	My	
exceptionally	strong	technical	skills	and	excellent	soft	skills	have	made	me	stand	out	professionally.	As	someone	who	
is	trilingual	and	has	lived	in	five	different	locations	I	embrace	cultural	differences	and	believe	in	the	power	of	
teamwork.	I	am	seeking	a	new	challenge	where	I	can	utilise	my	financial	expertise	and	business	judgment	and	push	
myself	to	new	boundaries.
